hypothesis: churn is caused by suboptimal allocation of cleaners to jobs

cleaners want:
- not to travel too far
- to have some notice for the jobs they're required for
- to have a continuous schedule
  to have work in all of their availability slots
- to hit their target hours

customers want:
- to reliably be able to get the job done
- to have a good cleaning job
  to know that the cleaner is trustworthy


- cleaners want to develop relationships with the customers (preferred cleaner for a job)
- cleaners will leave if they can't hit their target hours
  - or if they have to do too much travelling,
  - or if their jobs are too scattered in time
- customers will leave if they don't get their jobs done satisfactorily


Steps in this project:
- state the hypothesis
- test the hypothesis
- use the hypothesis to make a better matching algorithm
